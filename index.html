            <h1>The Aftermath of WWII</h1>
            <p>
                At the end of the first world war, it had been possible to contemplate going back to business as usual. However, 1945 was different.  The level of destruction had been so much greater than in the earlier war that much of Europe and Asia lay in ruins. And this time civilians had been the target as much as the military. The figures are hard to grasp: as many as 60 million dead, 25 million of them Soviet. A new word, “genocide,” entered the language to deal with the murder of 6 million of Europe's Jews by the Nazis.

                The once great powers of Japan and Germany looked as though they would never rise again.  Two powers, so great that the new term "superpower" had to be coined for them, dominated the world in 1945. The United States was both a military power and an economic one; the Soviet Union had only brute force and the intangible attraction of Marxist ideology (communism) to keep its own people down and manage its newly acquired empire in the heart of Europe.

                While the United States and the Soviet Union had worked together to defeat the Axis powers during WWII, their partnership quickly turned to a 50-year-long confrontation. They disagreed about how to rebuild Europe, they believed different things about the best form of government, they did not trust one another, they competed with one another, and they feared one another.  Each one had atomic bombs.  The Soviet Union wanted to spread their communist ideology into neighboring countries and the United States wanted to contain it.   Each nuclear-armed country wanted safety from one another and competed for supremacy around the world.  These motivations and circumstances were a dangerous mix for the safety of the world.

            </p>
            <h1>What was the Cold War?</h1>
            <p>
                This fierce conflict between the new global superpowers–the United States and the Soviet Union–is called the "Cold War" since the two superpowers never directly engaged in combat ("hot war"). Instead, they increased their military capabilities, tried to expand their global influence, and undermined the other's way of life in the eyes of the world. While the United States believed in a capitalist system of free markets and multiple political parties, the Soviet Union was founded on a communist system controlled by a centralized state and a single political party.
            </p>

                <li><a href="https://kids.britannica.com/students/article/capitalism/273506" target="_blank">capitalist system</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://kids.britannica.com/kids/article/communism/352989" target="_blank">Communist system</a></li>
            </ul>
            <h2>What were the major difference between the world-views of United States and Soviet Union</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Economy(Communist): Communist societies believed in redistributing wealth (taking from the rich and giving to the poor) and promoted workers and government-run economies. These resulted in low unemployment rates but often led to the unequal distribution of consumer goods.</li>
                <li>Way of life(Communist): The communist Soviet way of life, however, was based upon the will of a minority, the government, forcibly imposed upon the majority. It relied upon terrorizing and oppressing citizens, which was made possible through a controlled press and rigged elections.  They also viewed organized religion as dangerous.</li>
                <li>Economy(Capitalist): The US capitalist system let free markets determine the production and distribution of goods. This led to more productivity but often created massive economic inequalities. </li>
                <li>Way of Life(Capitalist): The American way of life was, and is, based upon the will of the majority, and is distinguished by free institutions, representative government, free elections, and guarantees of individual freedom, freedom of speech and religion, and freedom from political oppression.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Both sides also used propaganda to paint a negative picture of their enemies and a positive image of themselves. From 1945 until the collapse of the USSR in the 1990s, these two nations competed for global influence in the areas of military, economics, politics, and even culture.
            </p>
            <h2>Three key features defined the Cold War</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The threat of nuclear war,</li>
                <li>Competition over the allegiance (loyalty) of newly independent nations, and </li>
                <li>The military and economic support of each other's enemies around the world.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                After winning WWII, both the Soviet Union and the United States thought that they deserved to have leadership in global affairs.  The United States had a lot of advantages.  For example, the United States showed its global military dominance when it dropped two atomic bombs on Japan to end the war. This act prompted the USSR to seek nuclear technology to discourage American aggression. The United States held other advantages as well. Having entered World War II late in the conflict, it lost far fewer soldiers and civilians. The USSR lost 8-10 million soldiers (25 million including civilians) yet the United States lost 300,000 in the war. While the Soviet Union faced a devastating invasion, most of the United States emerged unscathed from the war. Finally, the US economy expanded during the war as it made profits selling weapons and supplies to the Allied forces.
            </p>
            <h1>A Divided Europe: East(Communist) and west (Capitalist)</h1>
            <p>
                After a long history of enemy invasions, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin wanted to expand the Soviet territory and build a buffer between the Soviet Union and Europe. He also wanted control in Central and Eastern European countries that the Soviets had helped liberate. As a result, Stalin quickly established strong communist parties that took power in Central and Eastern Europe (the Eastern Bloc). They took orders from the USSR. Meanwhile, the United States provided over $13 billion in aid for rebuilding Western European nations who agreed to open trade.
            </p>
            <p>
                This divided Europe, breaking trade networks and splitting communities between East and West. These economic divisions spread to separate military alliances in each zone. This further divided Europe along an imaginary line called the “Iron Curtain.” 
            </p>
            <p>
                The city of Berlin became a microcosm (small-scale representation) of the Cold War, with British, French, and Americans controlling West Berlin while the Soviets controlled East Berlin. Travel and cultural exchange across the Iron Curtain became increasingly difficult. To prevent people leaving East Berlin to the freer and richer West, East Germany built the Berlin Wall.  In 1948, the Communist government of East Berlin blocked access to West Berlin.  The US responded with the Berlin Airlift in which hundreds of tons of supplies were dropped from airplanes into West Berlin.  The Iron Curtain separated previously connected communities and created new ones living either under a communist or capitalist system.
            </p>
            <h1>The Cold War Heats Up Around the World</h1>
            <p>
                The Cold War started in Europe. From 1945 to 1953, the USSR expanded its influence by creating the Eastern Bloc across states like Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary. Stalin set up puppet communist governments that he could control. He repressed and punished anyone who resisted. The United States likewise began to meddle in the affairs of foreign nations where it feared communist regimes would gain control. This became known as a policy of containment.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the 1950s, competition had spread to the Middle East, Asia, and Latin America, with each side trying to establish control. By the 1960s, the Cold War reached Africa. Many former colonies achieved independence from European empires (decolonization). These new nations sided with the Americans or Soviets to receive economic and military aid. Both superpowers supported dictatorships that came to power through violence and repressed their societies—all to gain an edge in the global Cold War.
            </p>
            <h2>The Cold War in Asia</h2>
            <p>
                Some of the most important Cold War conflicts took place in Asia. Communists took power in China in 1949, and the Americans feared other countries would soon follow. In 1953, Korea had been divided into two zones, with a Communist government in the North and an American-leaning government in the South. To contain the spread of communism to South Korea, the US sent troops. The Chinese responded by sending their own troops to the border. The war killed nearly 5 million people but ended in a stalemate, leaving a divided Korea that remains today.
            </p>
            <h3>The Cold War in Vietnam</h3>
            <p>
                Perhaps no conflict illustrates the policy of containment better than Vietnam. Like Korea, Vietnam was divided into a communist north and pro-West south. To contain the communist north, the United States invaded in the 1960s. The Soviet Union sent money and weapons to the communist forces. By 1975, with the help of the Soviets and China, a small, poor nation defeated the strongest military superpower in the world. Over 58,000 Americans died in the conflict. The war divided Americans who were for or against the war. The US intervention in Vietnam exposed the hypocrisy of US policies that claimed to promote self-determination, and it inspired other small nations to determine their own futures.
            </p>
            <P>
                After the Vietnam War, Cold War tension briefly decreased. The Americans' defeat in Vietnam, the threat of nuclear war, and new Soviet leadership led to open discussions between the sides. But much like the Americans had in Vietnam, the USSR intervened in Afghanistan in the 1980s. It wanted to ensure the victory of a communist-leaning group and sent troops to assist them. The Soviet’s foreign policy was summarized in “The Brezhnev Doctrine.”  This policy proclaimed that any threat to socialist rule in any state of the Soviet bloc in Central and Eastern Europe was a threat to them all, and therefore justified the intervention of fellow socialist states.  Just as North Vietnam received aid and military assistance from the USSR, the United States backed Soviet enemies in Afghanistan with money and weapons. Ultimately, the USSR was equally unsuccessful, and US-backed forces emerged victorious. After much infighting, Islamic extremists called the Taliban claimed power in the region, thanks to American aid.
            </P>
            <h1>The End of Cold War</h1>
            <p>
                The Cold War finally ended in the 1990s. The USSR could no longer keep up with US military spending. Meanwhile, economic problems in the Eastern Bloc meant that goods were in short supply. To keep citizens from revolting, the new Soviet leader, Mikhael Gorbachev, proposed reforms to stimulate communist economies. The economic reforms were known as perestroika, or "restructuring." He also relaxed restrictions on freedom of expression, a policy called glasnost, or "openness." These reforms were too little too late.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1989, the most iconic symbol of the Iron Curtain, the Berlin Wall, which divided the German city, was torn down by Germans on both sides seeking to unify Germany. Similar waves of anti-communism spread throughout the Eastern Bloc. The end of the Cold War was marked by the disintegration of the USSR into over a dozen independent nations.
            </p>
            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>
                The fear of a nuclear war and Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) likely prevented direct combat between the Americans and the Soviets. Though they did not engage in all-out warfare, the two superpowers supported many of each other's enemies in combat. They created a bi-polar system of global power that forced other nations to choose sides: communism (USSR) or democracy (USA). The economic troubles created by the Soviet war in Afghanistan left the USSR unable to maintain control of the Eastern Bloc.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once self-determination was possible in the 1990s, many eastern European communist countries chose to reform their governments. They elected non-communist parties and joined the European Union. Outside of Europe, communists in places like Cuba and China have remained in power while other nations removed pro-US dictators.
            </p>
            <h3>Connection to Today:</h3>
            <p>
                For several years, Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced to his country that the collapse of the Soviet empire “was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century” and a tragedy for Russians.  In 2008, Putin said that “Ukraine is not even a state.”
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2021, Putin reiterated his concerns about Ukraine possibly joining NATO, describing it as a “direct threat” to Russia’s national security. He added that “Since time immemorial, the people living in the southwest of what has historically been Russian land have called themselves Russians…I will start with the fact that modern Ukraine was entirely created by Russia.”  He argues that Ukraine should belong to Russia and that they are “one people.”  The majority of people in Ukraine disagree.  Thousands of Ukranians are willing to die for their freedom and independence from Russian aggression.  Putin’s motivations for the invasion of Ukraine are rooted in the history of the Cold War and the fall of the USSR.
